## Git Basic Commands
**How to check Git Status**

```

**How to Clone a repo**

**How to Commit to Git**
```
git commit -m "Added new file"
```

**How to Push to Git**

**Note:** In case you will find an error during push, this means that you might not have the updated copy from the remote. So, you have to run the **git pull** first.

**How to Update local copy**

This can be done by either of the 2 commands -- **[git fetch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch)** or **[git pull](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull)**. The difference between the two is; **git fetch** does not merge changes from remote to local automatically. Whereas **git pull** merge the changes automatically. However, most of the time we will be using the **git pull**.

_This will fetch all the branch from remote that are not on your local_
```
git fetch origin
```
_This will fetch only the branch from remote that are not on your local_
```
git fetch origin feature_branch
```
